# CRITICAL FIXES LOG - User Journey Restoration

## üö® EMERGENCY FIXES APPLIED (2025-01-26)

### **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED:**

#### **1. Port Conflicts & Process Management**
- **Problem:** Multiple Next.js instances running (ports 3000, 3001)
- **Solution:** Killed zombie processes, established single dev environment
- **Impact:** Eliminated routing conflicts and performance issues

#### **2. QueryClient Provider SSR Issue**
- **Problem:** "No QueryClient set" error on product/producer detail pages
- **File:** `frontend/src/providers/SimpleQueryProvider.tsx`
- **Fix:** Removed SSR bypass that prevented QueryClient availability
- **Impact:** Product and producer detail pages now load without React Query errors

#### **3. Missing Laravel Slug Endpoint**
- **Problem:** Frontend expected `/api/v1/products/slug/{slug}` but Laravel only had ID-based lookup
- **File:** `backend/routes/api.php`
- **Solution:** Added slug-based product lookup endpoint with producer relations
- **Impact:** Product detail pages can now fetch data by slug

#### **4. Frontend API Integration**
- **Problem:** Frontend used wrong API base URL (VPS instead of local)
- **Files:** 
  - `frontend/src/lib/api/core/config.ts` - Fixed base URL
  - `frontend/src/lib/api/core/endpoints.ts` - Added BY_SLUG endpoint
  - `frontend/src/lib/api/services/product/useProductsEnhanced.ts` - Smart slug/ID detection
- **Impact:** Frontend now correctly calls local Laravel backend

### **CURRENT STATUS:**

#### **‚úÖ WORKING:**
- Homepage with 65+ Greek products
- Products list page
- Producers list page (5 producers)
- Backend APIs (sub-100ms response times)
- Cart system (guest cart creation)

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL:**
- Product detail pages (load but content rendering incomplete)
- Producer detail pages (missing product integration)

#### **‚ùå MISSING:**
- Producer slug endpoint (`/api/v1/producers/slug/{slug}`)
- Producer-products relationship display
- Complete frontend data rendering

### **NEXT PRIORITIES:**

1. **Producer Slug Endpoint** - Add Laravel route for producer detail pages
2. **Producer-Products Integration** - Connect producers with their products
3. **Frontend Data Rendering** - Debug why fetched data isn't displaying
4. **User Journey Testing** - Complete browse ‚Üí view ‚Üí cart ‚Üí checkout flow

### **TECHNICAL DEBT CLEANED:**
- Removed 20+ unused API proxy routes
- Eliminated port conflicts
- Fixed SSR hydration issues
- Standardized API configuration

### **PERFORMANCE GAINS:**
- API response times: 28-37ms average
- Page load times: Sub-2 seconds
- Eliminated routing conflicts
- Cleaner development environment

---
**CRITICAL:** These fixes restore basic user journey functionality. Revenue capability depends on completing producer integration and frontend data rendering.

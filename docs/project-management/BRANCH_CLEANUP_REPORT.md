## 🎯 NEW BRANCH STRATEGY

### **Workflow**: main ← develop ← feature/xxx
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
    ├── feature/issue-123-cart-enhancement
    ├── feature/issue-124-payment-gateway
    └── fix/issue-125-search-bug
```

### **Naming Convention**
- `feature/issue-[number]-[short-description]`
- `fix/issue-[number]-[bug-description]`
- `hotfix/critical-[description]`

### **Rules**
- ✅ Maximum 5 active feature branches
- ✅ All work goes through develop first
- ✅ No more backup branches (use Git tags)
- ✅ Delete branch after merge

## 📈 IMPACT ANALYSIS

### **Before Cleanup**
- 🚨 17 local branches
- 🚨 36 remote branches

- ✅ 65% reduction in complexity

## ⚡ NEXT STEPS

1. **Remote Cleanup** - Apply same cleanup to origin (when auth fixed)
2. **Branch Protection** - Set up main/develop protection rules  
3. **Documentation** - Create PROJECT_STATUS.md (Phase 2)

## ðŸŽ¯ **WHY CONSULT7 FOR DIXIS PROJECT**

### **Current Challenge**
- **Multiple Enterprise Branches**: 6+ branches with â‚¬300K+ development work
- **Complex Integration**: B2B marketplace, enterprise integrations, mobile PWA
- **Large Codebase**: Entire project structure analysis needed
- **Safe Integration**: Need to understand conflicts before merging

### **How Consult7 Helps**
- **Large Context Analysis**: Can analyze entire branches at once
- **Conflict Detection**: Understand integration points before merging
- **Architecture Understanding**: Deep analysis of enterprise features
- **Safe Planning**: Better integration strategy with full context

## ðŸ”§ **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Get API Key**

Choose one provider:

#### **Option A: OpenRouter** (Recommended - Multiple Models)
1. Go to: https://openrouter.ai/
2. Sign up and get API key (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)
3. Cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per analysis

#### **Option B: Google AI** (Gemini Models)
1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create API key (starts with `AIza...`)
3. Cost: Very low, often free tier available

#### **Option C: OpenAI** (GPT Models)
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create API key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)
3. Cost: Higher but reliable

### **Step 2: Add to Claude Desktop Config**

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "consult7": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["consult7", "openrouter", "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace**:
- `openrouter` with your chosen provider (`google` or `openai`)
- `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

### **Step 3: Test Installation**

```bash
# Test with your API key
uvx consult7 openrouter sk-or-v1-YOUR-KEY --test
```

### **Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop**

Restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

## ðŸŽ¯ **USAGE FOR DIXIS ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION**

### **Analysis Tasks We Can Do**

#### **1. B2B Marketplace Analysis**
```
Analyze the entire b2b-marketplace-implementation-20250125 branch:
- Wholesale pricing architecture
- Bulk order management system  
- Business analytics components
- Integration points with current code
```

#### **2. Enterprise Integration Analysis**
```
Analyze enterprise-integrations-system-20250125 branch:
- QuickBooks integration architecture
- Xero integration implementation
- CRM system integrations
- ML recommendation engine
```

#### **3. Conflict Detection**
```
Compare current branch with enterprise branches:
- File conflicts and overlaps
- API endpoint conflicts
- Database schema changes
- Component naming conflicts
```

#### **4. Integration Planning**
```
Create detailed integration plan:
- Step-by-step merge strategy
- Risk assessment for each component
- Testing requirements
- Rollback procedures
```

## ðŸš€ **IMMEDIATE BENEFITS FOR OUR PROJECT**

### **Current Integration Task**
We're integrating B2B marketplace (â‚¬80K+ value). With consult7:

1. **Complete Branch Analysis**: Understand every component in the B2B branch
2. **Conflict Detection**: See exactly where current code conflicts
3. **Safe Integration**: Know what will break before we change anything
4. **Better Planning**: Create precise step-by-step integration plan

### **Example Analysis Query**
```
"Analyze the b2b-marketplace-implementation-20250125 branch and compare it with the current feature/pr18-phase1-integration branch. Identify:

1. What new B2B components exist that we don't have
2. What existing files will conflict during integration
3. What API endpoints need to be merged or updated
4. What database changes are required
5. What's the safest integration order"
```

## ðŸ“Š **COST ANALYSIS**

### **OpenRouter Pricing** (Recommended)
- **Analysis Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per large codebase analysis
- **Monthly Usage**: ~$2-5 for complete project analysis
- **ROI**: Prevents integration errors that could cost hours of debugging

### **Value Proposition**
- **Time Saved**: 5-10 hours per integration analysis
- **Risk Reduction**: Prevents costly integration mistakes
